<h1>Explain the difference between the DIV and SPAN tags. Provide a scenario where
    each is more appropriate to use. </h1>

<h1>DIV</h1>
<ol>
    <li>It's a block-level element used to group and structure content on a web page.</li>
    <li>It's commonly used to create divisions or sections of content, and it often contains other block-level and
        inline elements.</li>
    <li>It's commonly used for applying styles or layout structures, and it helps in organizing the content for styling
        and positioning purposes.</li>
</ol>

<div id='header'>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
</div>
<div id='main-content'>
    <p>This is the main content of the page.</p>
</div>
<div id='footer'>
    <p>Contact us at info@example.io</p>
</div>

<h1>SPAN</h1>
<ol>
    <li>It's an inline-level element used to apply styles or manipulate a specific portion of text within a block-level
        element.
    </li>
    <li>It is often used when you want to apply styles, scripting, or other modifications to a small piece of text or
        content within a larger container.
    </li>
    <li>Unlike the div, which is a block-level element, the span is an inline element and is generally used for
        smaller, inline-level content.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>This is a <span style='color: blue;'>blue</span> word in a paragraph.</p>
